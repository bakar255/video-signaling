## WebRTC Signaling Server for Teleconsultation

A high-performance, real-time WebRTC signaling server built with Rust and Actix, designed specifically for peer-to-peer teleconsultation applications. This server handles the signaling layer required for establishing direct video/audio connections between healthcare practitioners and patients, ensuring secure and efficient communication without intermediate servers relaying media streams. 

For the context this projet has been done for a wellness platform SaaS.

The server acts as the signaling backbone for WebRTC connections while maintaining complete privacyâ€”all media streams flow directly between participants, ensuring patient confidentiality and compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.
